# Cross-compilation configuration for restic-manager
# Enables building Linux binaries from Windows/macOS

[target.x86_64-unknown-linux-musl]
# cargo-zigbuild handles this automatically when using `cargo zigbuild`
# No explicit linker configuration needed

[target.aarch64-unknown-linux-musl]
# ARM64 Linux support (e.g., Raspberry Pi, ARM servers)
# Also handled by cargo-zigbuild

[build]
# Uncomment to set default target for this project
# target = "x86_64-unknown-linux-musl"

[env]
# Ensure rustls is used instead of OpenSSL (already configured in Cargo.toml)
# This avoids cross-compilation issues with native TLS libraries
